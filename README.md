# 🧠 Custom Reasoning Model using LLaMA 3.2 + Facebook Natural Reasoning Dataset


This project focuses on building a custom reasoning-centric language model from scratch, leveraging the Facebook/Natural_Reasoning dataset and the LLaMA 3.2 architecture (licensed). The goal is to fine-tune the model to perform advanced semantic rewording, paraphrasing, and reasoning-based reformulations of natural language inputs.


# 🧬 Project Objective


Develop a domain-specific rewording model capable of understanding and preserving semantic meaning while restructuring language using advanced reasoning patterns.
The final model can be integrated into downstream applications such as:

- AI Writing Assistants
- Context-Aware Summarizers
- Human-like Paraphrasing Systems
- Advanced Conversational Agents

# 📚 Dataset


Facebook/Natural_Reasoning
A curated dataset with emphasis on:

- Logical consistency
- Semantic inference
- Multi-step reasoning
- Natural sentence reformulations
- The dataset is used to guide the model's understanding of deep semantic structures in natural language.



# ⚙️ Model Architecture

Component	Description
Base Model	LLaMA 3.2 (Meta AI licensed variant)
Training	Custom fine-tuning on reasoning data using LoRA / PEFT
Tokenizer	LLaMA tokenizer with additional tokens for reasoning tags
Framework	PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers
Evaluation	BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, plus a custom logic-coherence metric



# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧠 Model: LLaMA 3.2 (fine-tuned)

- 🧪 Training Framework: 🤗 Transformers, 🤗 Datasets, PyTorch, Accelerate

- 🧱 LoRA / PEFT: Lightweight adapter layers for efficient fine-tuning

- 💾 Data Handling: Hugging Face Datasets

- 📊 Evaluation: Custom NLP metrics + Hugging Face evaluate

- ⚙️ Deployment-ready: Export to ONNX, TorchScript or quantized for edge use


# 🚀 Training Pipeline

- Data Preprocessing
- Convert FB Natural Reasoning examples into question-response pairs.
- Augment with rule-based and GPT-generated paraphrase variants.
- Fine-Tuning Loop
- LoRA-based fine-tuning on multiple GPUs (DeepSpeed/FSDP supported).
- Custom loss focusing on:
- Logical equivalence
- Syntactic diversity
- Semantic preservation
- Evaluation
- Compared against baseline models (T5, GPT-3.5-turbo).
- Uses both automatic metrics and human annotator feedback.


# 🧪 Example Use Case


Input:

 "A dog is running through a park while chasing a ball."

Output:

 "While chasing a ball, a dog races across the park grounds."

🔁 The model preserves meaning while rephrasing the structure using learned reasoning pathways.
